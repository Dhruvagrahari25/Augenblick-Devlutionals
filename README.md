# Anomaly Detection Project

This project leverages anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in sensor data. It uses machine learning models to detect outliers, helping in monitoring systems for potential issues or irregular behavior.

## Features
- Real-time anomaly detection from sensor data.
- Streamlit-based interactive interface for visualizing the results.
- Supports Python 3.12 and easy setup via requirements.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r req.txt

3. Ensure Python 3.12 is installed.
4. Run the Project
Start the application with:

   streamlit run sensor.py
